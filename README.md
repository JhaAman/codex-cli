# Codex CLI
Translate english to bash commands via OpenAI Codex

To use, create a `.env` file, and put in your OpenAI key, titled `OPENAI_KEY`. Then, run `python nlsh.py` in the terminal, and type in some English prompts for the AI to turn into Bash!

Some examples:
- Print the current working directory
- What's the day today?
- Count all python files here
- Create a new react app named "sam_altman"
- Create a new git repo, add and commit all files
- Add 'node_modules' to the gitignore
